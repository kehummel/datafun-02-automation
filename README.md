# datafun-02-automation

We cover more syntax and see how repetition and loops can help us organize and implement a professional data analytics project. 

We add folders (aka directories) to hold our data, and curl to fetch data and our earlier module from the web. 

We'll learn to script a series of folders and files, and how to delete and rerun.  

We'll use Python skills to build an artificially intelligent agent that will listen for changes to a folder and respond when a new file arrives.
